    <h1>Problems & Pain Points</h1>
    <p class="intro">In hospital especially both government and private ones patients often face long queues even those who arrive in emergency situation are told to wait in line. They are handed a from and asked to fill it out first before any medical assistances is provided.
      Both government and private hospital charge fees even just for assigning a bed for rest. Private hospitals in particular begin billing within an hour of admission which becomes unaffordable for poor patients.as a results many patients return home in distress because they cannot effort the high costs.
      Government hospitals are no better staff behaviour is often poor, and they don’t communicate respectfully with patients, a patient has no run form one counter to another facing confusion and frustration. It takes tremendous effort for a patient to finally reach the doctor only to be told that the doctor shift is over and to come back the next day.
      If the doctor see the patient it’s usually just for 1 or 2 min. despite this full consultation fees are charged .government doctors often show indifferent or rude behaviour while some private doctors are at least slightly more considerate possible because they are being paid directly by the patient. The government hospital system makes it even harder patients must first stand in long lines just to get a slip then are sent elsewhere for more slips or process by the time the patient reaches the doctor the entire day is lost. Even then they might hear that the doctor is unavailable in surgery or elsewhere if by chance the doctor quickly names a few time check the patient and patients hand another slip and ask them to come back again next day
